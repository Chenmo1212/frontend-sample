Frontend sample work project for ContractHound

* Please fork this project. Please do not issue a PR on this repository.
* Made your changes in your fork and then give me access to the fork

Please follow these rules:

* The only file to be edited is index.html. I have included some of the JS and CSS files used to render the page. You should not need to edit these.
* You should not add any more JS or CSS files
* You may use from the iconset we are using, which are the free icons from fontawesome <i style="fa fa-iconname"> will give you a font to work with
* There are two "markers" in index.html on lines 352 and 458. Please only make changes between those lines
* You may use any of the builtin bootstrap classes or any of the marked up creative-tim.com classes

The goal is to understand if you can improve the layout, design & and organisation of the page with little to no guidance using stock classes from Bootstrap & the Creative-tim theme.
